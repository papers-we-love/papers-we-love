## Contributing Guidelines

We have a few guidelines in place to keep the repo clean and easy to navigate. Follow these conventions in your pull-request for a speedy merge.

* Directory names are undercased and separated by underscores (example: `artificial_intelligence`)
* Paper names are undercased and separated by dashes (example: `out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf`). Use the full title when possible.
